Description: Functions to read accelerometer data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors. The package has been developed and tested for binary data from 'GENEActiv' <https://www.activinsights.com/> and GENEA devices (not for sale), and .cwa-format data from 'Axivity' <https://axivity.com>. These devices are currently widely used in research on human daily physical activity.
