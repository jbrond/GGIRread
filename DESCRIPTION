Description: Functions to read accelerometer data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors. The package has been developed and tested for binary data from 'GENEActiv' <https://www.activinsights.com/> and GENEA devices (not for sale), and .cwa-format data from 'Axivity' <https://axivity.com>. These devices are currently widely used in research on human daily physical activity. Further, the package can handle accelerometer data file from any other sensor brand providing that the data is stored in csv format and has either no header or a two column header.
